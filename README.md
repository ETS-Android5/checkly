# Checkly
Checkly is an android application used to check multiple-choiced exam sheets using optical character recognition (OCR) from Google Vision API. This is a high school capstone project developed for final requirements at Cavite State University Laboratory Science High School - Main. 

## Demo
Install ```/app/demo/app-debug.apk``` or build the project using Android Studio. 
1. Press ``Do check`` button at the main view.
2. When prompted, add test answer keys for the test sheets.
3. Press ``Do check`` button again.
4. Test the app using a sample answered sheet at ``/app/demo/test_sheet.png``.

## Notes
1. Google Vision OCR can only read text blocks, hence, the formatted answer sheets. 
2. This project will no longer be maintained.
